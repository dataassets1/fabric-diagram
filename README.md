# Diagrams for Microsoft Fabric in Draw.IO

# How to use that template
## Method 1 - Online Draw.IO
This method is good if you need:
- quick access to diagramming in your browser with an Internet connection

Steps:
1. Open https://app.diagrams.net/
2. Go to Menu -> Extras -> Configuration
3. Add code there:
```
{
  "templateFile": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataassets1/fabric-diagram/refs/heads/main/v1.01/template/FabricTemplate.xml"
}
```
4. Create a new diagram and select a Microsoft Template


## How to use that template - Method 2
This method is good if you need:
 - The offline DrawIO application
Its limitation is:
 - You need to add a custom library every time you create a new diagram - it takes 10 seconds, but adds that hassle

Steps:
1. Right Click -> Save Link As -> to your dedicated folder for Draw.IO libraries:
- [Fabric Draw.IO Library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataassets1/fabric-diagram/refs/heads/main/v1.01/Fabric.xml)
- [Core Draw.IO Library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataassets1/fabric-diagram/refs/heads/main/v1.01/Core.xml)


2. Open Draw.IO (offline or online)
3. Select Menu -> File -> Open library from -> Your device -> Select each library from the step 1
4. You may see these libraries on the left side
